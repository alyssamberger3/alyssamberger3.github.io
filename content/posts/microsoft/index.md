## The DIY Generation - What Do They Look For?
{{< split 4 4 4 >}}

#### üèÖ Authenticity
Authenticity is crucial for Gen Z and Millennials. Having grown up amidst an overwhelming amount of information, they often find it challenging to discern genuine content. They highly value quality service that includes a personal touch, as it makes them feel recognized and appreciated as individuals.

#### üé® Personalization
These generation values brands that recognize their unique preferences and offer tailored experiences. Personalized recommendations enhance this bespoke feel, catering specifically to users' tastes.

---

#### üèéÔ∏è Efficiency
Millennials and Gen Z prioritize quick and accurate online service, with Millennials being more tolerant of service lapses than Gen Z. Both groups expect instant, precise responses and value efficient digital interactions, reflecting their high expectations for customer service.

## What Should We Consider Moving Forward? 

{{< split 4 4 4 >}}

#### üíÖ First Article/Post = First Impression 
Users most commonly enter Microsoft's self-help platforms organically through a Google search. How can that first article or post they interact with help form a positive experience?

---

#### üö® How can Microsoft Offer Options for Immediate Support?
If the first support article or community post they come across does not help resolve the issue, how can Microsoft effectively present other options or resources?

---

#### üßò Maintaining Balance with What Works
It is crucial to implement changes to the current platforms in a way that preserves what already works (especially for existing users) while also catering to the needs of younger users

## Challenges We Faced

{{< split 6 6 >}}

#### Time Constraints

A significant challenge we faced was the limited time available, which restricted our ability to conduct extensive evaluations and develop in-depth testing. To mitigate this, we scaled back the ambitiousness of our research and shifted our focus away from finalized designs towards deeper insights.

---

#### Conceptual Wireframes

Due to the breadth of our research, there was insufficient time to develop fully fleshed-out user flows for comprehensive testing. To mitigate this, we emphasized creating a solid base for following semesters to work on and develop what we could not complete.

## Self-Reflection
- This project offered a valuable opportunity to apply classroom concepts to a real-world Microsoft initiative. **As my first sponsored research experience**, it was incredibly rewarding to see academic knowledge translate into impactful outcomes.

- **Generational Insights:** Initially focused on differentiating Millennials and Gen Z, we identified opportunities to enhance our analysis. Moving forward, we will integrate nuanced distinctions and compelling examples to highlight unique behavioral patterns, improving the precision and impact of our findings.

- **User Journey Analysis:** I developed a deeper appreciation for analyzing specific stages of the user journey. While our current approach provided key insights, future efforts will leverage detailed journey maps and case studies to identify pivotal interaction points and deliver more targeted solutions.

- This project has transformed my approach to research and presentation. I‚Äôve refined my ability to highlight subtle nuances and deliver precise, actionable insights, **strengthening my expertise as a researcher.**
