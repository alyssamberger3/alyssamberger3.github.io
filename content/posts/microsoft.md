## The Basics
##### 🤝 The Team

A group of 10 UX Design students with varied experiences  collaborated to produce a UX Research project for Microsoft’s self-help sector.

We collaborated with 1 Principle CX Manager, 1 Senior UX Researcher, 1 Social Media Team Lead and 1 University Research Manager from Microsoft.

##### 🚀 Research Outcomes
1. Enhancing touchpoints across support platforms to improve resource discoverability.
2. Incorporating personalization to provide tailored and relevant resources to users.

##### 📅 The Timeframe
The project ran from January 2024 to May 2024, with continuation projects in subsequent semesters.

## Research Problem
In an era where instant digital gratification is not just desired but expected, Microsoft’s user feedback and engagement metrics reveal a significant gap in its self-help resources, particularly for its youngest and most tech-savvy users: Millennials and Gen Z. These users often perceive current support platforms as overly complex or misaligned with their expectations for quick, efficient, and seamless digital support solutions.

This disconnect not only diminishes user satisfaction but also risks long-term loyalty and engagement with Microsoft products—an especially critical concern as this demographic emerges as the dominant consumer segment.
