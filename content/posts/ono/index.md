## The Basics
ü§ù **The Team**

Two Purdue students at various points within the John Martinson Honors program collaborated to produce a U.S. Department of State project focusing on the Old Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C.

Our primary sources were official documents from the United States, which we obtained through access to records held by the National Archives and Library of Congress. We also consulted with subject matter experts affiliated with the U.S. Department of State to supplement our research.

{{< textbox title="Project Overview" text="The project involves researching and analyzing the Old Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C., exploring its history and its potential use of slave labor during construction. Initiated by the U.S. Department of State, the project is the outcome of a nationwide bid process that sees faculty submit representative applications for a given university in favor of a specific project. Although multiple schools may submit bids for the same topic, access to the topic is not guaranteed if their bid is not accepted. This project brings together students from diverse disciplines at Purdue University to collaborate on and document the Old Naval Observatory and the ethical concerns regarding its origins." fromcolor="#205493 50%" tocolor="#112e51" angle="60deg" textcolor="white">}}

## What is Diplomacy Lab?
Diplomacy Lab engages the American public in the work of the State Department to address complex global challenges by broadening the State Department‚Äôs research base. Diplomacy Lab harnesses the expertise and fresh perspectives of students and faculty members across the nation to research key foreign policy topics. By guiding student teams through real-world challenges identified by the State Department, the initiative provides policymakers with diverse perspectives and practical research solutions to inform their decision-making process.

## The Research Process
To date, the research process has primarily revolved around a week-long trip to Washington, D.C., to study primary sources related to the Old Naval Observatory. These sources included construction payroll records and correspondence regarding the acquisition of the Observatory's oceanographic and astronomical charts. This immersive experience provided exposure to a broad array of topics, some of which could suggest ethical concerns surrounding the facility's construction.

Following the trip to D.C., the research continued. For documents that required further examination, we captured photographs and transcriptions to facilitate in-depth analysis at a later date. Artificial intelligence has played a crucial role in this phase, assisting us in deciphering aged handwriting and interpreting faded documents efficiently. Such models as Claude and Copilot have proven vital in deciphering such texts and James M. Gilis‚Äôs attempts to hire staff or payrolls drafted on onion skin paper. While all details still require checking and revision, the starting point artificial intelligence provides has demonstrated invaluable assistance in understanding the past of the Old Naval Observatory.

## What's Ahead
In the coming months, we will refine the findings gathered during our research and compile them into a publication for submission to the U.S. Department of State. Our work will contribute to determining the future of the Old Naval Observatory. At present, the building remains closed to the public due to concerns about asbestos and its unstable structure. While there are planned efforts to revitalize the facility due to its historical ties, there are further considerations as to how the building may be used that will be determined in part due to our research.
Future plans envision the facility being redeveloped as a library. However, it's essential to recognize the site's complex historical connections to slavery, which may necessitate additional thought and consideration regarding its use and potential restrictions on repurposing the space.
