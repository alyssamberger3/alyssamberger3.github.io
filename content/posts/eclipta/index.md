## Overall Limitations

{{< split 4 4 4 >}}

#### 🎤 User Interviews
Due to access, we interviewed disproportionately more females than males

---

#### 🙅 Our Access
Due to the sensitivity of information such as two-factor authentication, tax details, and card data, sponsor involvement was necessary, limiting what could be completed in the moment

---

#### ⚖️ Legal Constraints
Trademarks, patents, and GTINs are required to establish an Amazon shop

## Self-Reflection
- **Creative Freedom & New Beginnings:** Eclipta offered a refreshing change from my previous structured projects, allowing our team to be the first to set up both a Shopify and an Amazon store — an experience that came with both freedom and responsibility.

- **Deepening Design Emphasis:** From experimenting with page layouts to refining design fidelities, I had the chance to sharpen my UX skills while also expanding my knowledge in areas like SEO and trademark law.

- **Personal & Professional Connection:** This project uniquely blended my professional interests with a health-conscious and well-being-based beauty brand, letting me experience UX design through a lens that felt both meaningful and inspiring.
