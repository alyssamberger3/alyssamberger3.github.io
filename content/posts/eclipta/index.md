## Self-Reflection
- **Creative Freedom & New Beginnings:** Eclipta offered a refreshing change from my previous structured projects, allowing our team to be the first to set up both a Shopify and Amazon store—an experience that came with both freedom and responsibility.

- **Deepening Design Emphasis:** From experimenting with page layouts to refining design fidelities, I had the chance to sharpen my UX skills while also expanding my knowledge in areas like SEO and trademark law.

- **Personal & Professional Connection:** This project uniquely blended my professional interests with a health-conscious and wellbeing-based beauty brand, letting me experience UX design through a lens that felt both meaningful and inspiring.
